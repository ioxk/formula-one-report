      "content": "The new regulations of the 2021 season forced teams to adjust to the decreased levels of downforce that new cars now produce. The cause of this new reality that aerodynamicists are facing is the area that is now cut off at the rear of the floor. The teams that are expected to be negatively affected from this change are those that have followed a low rake design approach such as Mercedes and Aston Martin. Red Bull will find themselves gaining advantage due to the high rake design of the car. The Austrian team are running with a rake angle ranging close to 2 degrees depending on the race specific requirements. The rest of the teams on the grid are following moderate angle design strategies and the effect of the change is expected not to be as significant on their performance."

      "title": "Updated regulations and effects",
      "content": "Significant technical regulation changes have been applied for the new season. The new Pirelli tyres are having higher durability in order to improve racing safety. This will allow the teams to follow strategies with fewer pit stops and stay out on track for longer stints. Heavier cars is another aspect to consider as teams will be allowed to strengthen their chassis. The length of the fins placed atÂ  the rear brake duct and the height of the fence underneath the diffuser are both now restricted. Combined with the triangular area in front off the rear wheels that has been removed, they cause significantly reduced downforce. Teams will need to mitigate those losses by seeking possible improvements on parts of the car that regulations have not targeted."
